## 📝 CONTENT TRANSFORMATION GUIDELINES

When creating new course pages, follow the Introduction pattern:

### Structure

1. **Hero Section**: Course title, description, metadata (duration, difficulty, module)
2. **Parts/Sections**: Divide content into 5-7 major parts
3. **Visual Elements**:
   - Interactive timelines
   - Comparison tables (red vs green)
   - Numbered section markers
   - Hero cards with gradients
   - Process flows with steps
   - Callout boxes for key concepts

### Design Patterns

- **Historical Content**: Use timeline visualization with decade markers
- **Comparisons**: Side-by-side cards (Traditional vs Blockchain)
- **Processes**: Numbered cards with icons and descriptions
- **Key Concepts**: Callout boxes with lightbulb/target icons
- **Technical Details**: Layered cards with border-left accent colors
- **Challenges**: Red/orange accent with alert icons
- **Solutions**: Green accent with checkmark icons

### Content Principles

- Start with context and "why"
- Use real-world analogies
- Provide multiple perspectives (visual, textual, examples)
- Break down complex concepts into digestible chunks
- Include practical implications
- Show both benefits and challenges
- End each section with key takeaways

  - **Process**:
    1. Created directory structure for all 6 courses
    2. Used `sed` commands to extract course content from original file:
       - Introduction: lines 45-2053 → `introduction/page.tsx` (2,046 lines)
       - Security: lines 2056-4757 → `security/page.tsx` (2,738 lines)
       - Hashing: lines 4761-6037 → `hashing/page.tsx` (1,276 lines, Parts I-III only)
    3. Created placeholder pages for remaining 3 courses (financial, smart-contracts, advanced)
    4. Fixed TypeScript errors:
       - Removed duplicate `return` statements
       - Added missing icon imports (Target, ShieldCheck, FileCheck, Hash, Wallet, AlertTriangle, etc.)
       - Fixed HTML structure with proper div nesting
  - **Benefits**: Better organization, faster compilation, easier maintenance, improved performance
